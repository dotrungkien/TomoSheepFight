## WHAT this PR do?
- ex: Change number items `completed/total` in admin page.

## HOW
- ex: I edit js file, inject not_vary_normal items in calculate function.

## WHY
- ex: Because in previous version - number just depends on `normal` items. But in new version, we have `state` and `confirm_state` depends on both `normal` + `not_normal` items.
